          Hi, I'm Ji Min Lee â€” a developer passionate about building human-centered technologies, clean code, and meaningful products.
          <br />
          <br />
          I'll be joining the MS in Computer Science program at USC this August, after working as a full-stack engineer in Korea.
          <br />
          <br />
          Outside of coding, I'm enjoying capturing moments with my film camera ðŸ“¸learning electric guitarðŸŽ¸, love dancing, and enjoy both basketball and football (a loyal Tottenham fan âš½). I'm also
          a longtime T1 supporter in League of Legends ðŸŽ® â€” and above all, I deeply love animals.
          <br />
          <br />
          This blog is a place for me to reflect, share what I learn, and document my journey as a developer and a person. Thanks for stopping by!
